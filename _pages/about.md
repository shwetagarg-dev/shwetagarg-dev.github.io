I am passionate about solving meaningful problems that profoundly improve people's lives globally through artificial intelligence. As an Applied Science Manager at AWS, I currently lead the science team for [Amazon CodeWhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/) and [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/) in IDEs. My team focuses on developing large language models and generative AI to enable more natural human-computer interaction and streamline workflows for software developers. My aim is to build AI systems with deep natural language understanding that seamlessly respond to and converse with people, unlocking new possibilities for human-technology collaboration. I thrive on tackling complex challenges at the intersection of language, AI, and human-computer interaction. My vision is a future enabled by collaborative AI that empowers people to focus on their most creative and fulfilling work.

Before joining AWS, I worked at Alexa Natural language understanding team where I led the development of data augmentation, few-shot learning and semi-supervised learning components. My Amazon related blogs/papers can be found at [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/author/varun-kumar)
website. 

I graduated from [University Of Maryland, College Park (UMD)](https://www.cs.umd.edu) in 2017. At UMD, I primarily worked on Human-In-The-Loop topic modeling project to incorporate non-experts feedback into topic modeling. Before joining UMD, I worked as a software engineer at Tata Research Development and Design Centre, India for 3 years.
