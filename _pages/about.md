I am driven to solve big, meaningful problems using AI that profoundly improve people's lives on a global scale. In my current role as an Applied Science Manager at [AWS CodeWhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/), I lead a team of scientists pushing the boundaries of large language modeling and generative AI to facilitate more natural human-computer interaction and streamline workflows for software developers. My goal is to build AI systems that seamlessly understand and respond to natural language, unlocking new possibilities for how we interact with technology. 

Before joining AWS, I worked at Alexa Natural language understanding team where I led the development of data augmentation, few-shot learning and semi-supervised learning components. My Amazon related blogs/papers can be found at [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/author/varun-kumar)
website. 

I graduated from [University Of Maryland, College Park (UMD)](https://www.cs.umd.edu) in 2017. At UMD, I primarily worked on Human-In-The-Loop topic modeling project to incorporate non-experts feedback into topic modeling. Before joining UMD, I worked as a software engineer at [Tata Research Development and Design Centre (TRDDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Research_Development_and_Design_Centre), India for 3.5 years.
